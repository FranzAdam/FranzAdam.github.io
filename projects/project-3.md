When I was younger, going to elementary school, my paternal grandfather taught me how to play chess. I was immediately hooked and really enjoyed playing the game. I used to play him after school and in my free time and over the years I went to a couple of small tournaments and it really became one of my favorite hobbies. I never pursued it on a serious level, as my athletic focus was on swimming, but nevertheless chess as a hobby stayed with me throughout all high school. To this day I enjoy playing, watching tournaments and analyzing games.

I decided as one of my projects in college to develop a working chess move finder. The algorithm will find the best move (for this algorithm, in a given time) for a given position and will return the move suggestion and position evaluation. I will use Java for the implementation as I have the most experience in this language. I am using several resources to help me with the development, one of them is [this website]().

With any major stepping stones or walls I hit I will update this post.
