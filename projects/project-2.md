## Introduction
For the final project in the ICS 314 class, my team and I have chosen to create a web application, that simplifies the way in which athletic trainers and athletes communicate, work together, and create solutions. For the original project idea, please follow this [Link](https://franzadam.github.io/essays/FinalProjectIdea.html). <br/>
Our final version of the application can be found [Here](https://athleticheck.xyz). Our team members can be found [Here](https://athleticheck.xyz/#/about). We started out team finding process on November 5th, started working the day after and deployed our final version of the application on December 16th. During these one and a half months, we completed three major steps, which were roughly split up into Idea gatherings, Front End and Back End. We were collaboratively working on this project using Github and we were using Issue Driven Project Management, where we collaboratively addressed issues, assigned them to one another and worked on them. Each group member was using IntellIJ as their development environment together with Github Desktop to distinctly work on branches that reflected the individual issues. The idea to this application came to me after firsthand experiencing the low efficiency with that athletic trainers often communicate and organize their athletes. I think a more advanced mobile application like this can far reaching potential in the U.S. college sport market. 
## Front End
My contribution to this project’s front end were design evaluation for the overall theme of the website (that was basically an overall decision-making progress of all team member). I solely was responsible for design of Sign In and Sign Up Page as well as the Add Visit page.
#### Sign Up:

  * New athletes (users) can register an account with AthletiCheck.
#### Sign In:
<img class="ui medium right floated rounded image" src="/images/login.png">
  * Current athletes (users) can sign in to their profile to view their profiles.
#### Add Visit
<img class="ui medium right floated rounded image" src="/images/AddVisit.png">
  * ATs can add Visits to athlete’s profiles.
<br/> 
## Back End
My contributions include the Sign In and Sign Up implementations as well as all the Tests used to test our program. 
## Other
My contributions also included, finding test users, collecting their feedback and analyzing it. Also, I was working on .io page, which can be found [Here](https://athleticheck.github.io/).
In addition to that I wanted to point out that all members of our team helped each other with different problems and areas. There were always situations where people got stuck on problems and other people could provide a solution.
If anyone is interested in the actual code, the link to our github page can be found [Here](https://github.com/athleticheck/athleticheck).

## Conclusion
This was my first time working on a web application with a group of people over an extended amount of time. I can say that I gained valuable experience in many different areas of expertise. Not only software development based, but also in terms of collaboration and what it takes to effectively work in a team.
