Since a couple of years I was very intrigued to learn the russian language. I think their culture and far-reaching history is particularly interesting. Part of why I think that is probably because my parents have russian roots. My mother grew up in Moscow and my paternal grandfather worked in the Soviet Union. Bottom line is, I would like to learn that language but I never allocated the needed amount of time to do so. But when the first lockdowns were introduced in March/April I finally took the time and started it off. Growing up with german, learning italian in school and learning english later, I think I have a good base for learning a new language, even though the cyrillic alphabet is different from the latin one and the languages' root is slavic and not germanic. I am using a combination of [Pimsleur](https://www.pimsleur.com) for practical speaking and understanding and a simple textbook, covering the grammatical and teaching sentence style. about half a year in, I would say I am on a working level so far. I will definitely update that post in later time and inform you about my process.
