I was always a big fan of video games and games in general. Playing video games sparked up my interest in computers and software in my early stages of childhood. Since then I always wanted to create games one time in my life and I as I grew up in the rapidly changing computer development era, I found it fascinating how much better and more realistic games got each year. Being part of a developer team and collaborate on really cool games at some point in my life is definitely a goal of mine. In the meantime, busy with college classes and athletics, I am just experience game development on a very small scale. So a year back I created this small game on Java, called Cave Escape. It is really more of a free time hobby of mine, rather then anything serious. I have been working on it about 50 hours until now, really only when I got some free time and feel like it or after my school assignments to relax.
I coded it in Java with Lightweight Java Game Library and some basic math libraries. You can find a small intro to the first level [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KjiXv2UY0k)
