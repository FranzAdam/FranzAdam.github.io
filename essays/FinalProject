# Overview
Ever since the transission to electronic medical record systems for athletic staff at university sports programs, a tremendous amount of time has been spent on recording
athletes' data due to the fact that most EMR systems do not provide a user friendly interface and are not easily accessible, so athletic trainer often record data and then copy it into the system at the end of the day.
How do I aswsume that? Over the summer my colleague and me have concluded around 80 interviews with different athletic trainers in U.S. colleges, ranging from D1 to Junior level programs, and the collected data shows 
that ATs spend anywhere from 2-4 hours a day on documentation. This holds true for the ATs at UH as well. 
My proposed solution to this problem is an easily accessible web application for the UH athletics community where data can be entried and received easily on both ends to save time on documentation and make up more time to actually treat UH's athletes.

# Case Ideas
The landing page will be a login portal to either sign in as an athlete or AT. 
Logged in as athlete, the athlete can only see their Treatment profile page, where injury reports, current rehab plan and a comment section for any other issues is displayed.
The athlete will only be able to edit the comment section.
Logged in as an AT, the athletic trainer can look up any registered athlete and go to their page and edit injury report, rehab plans and leave a comment for the athlete.

# Beyond the Basics
After implementing the web application and integrating the features to the website, these future advancements to the application could be in scope for this project:
- Add a feature that generates a pdf with all valuable information on the athletes current status to then be easily added on to the EMR system. 
- Add email notifications for athletes (and possible coaches) that let them know when the AT changes anything in their treatment plan or adds a comment.
- A COVID-19 checkup that similar to LumiSight, lets athletes complete the, what is now a google doc form, Covid-19 check form to be sure to depart to campus. 
- A appointment scheduling feature that lets athletes see the ATs free appointment times and lets them schedule one on the website.
