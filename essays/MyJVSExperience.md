Starting universtiy with C as my only prior language experience and starting off my ICS major with learning Java in the first modules,
I felt really comfortable writing in Javascript so far. I think it definitely is easier and quicker to learn than the languages I used before.
Comparing it to Java, I enjoy the the easiness it provides with declaring variables, accessing arrays in different ways and writing functions with mutiple return types. 
It definitely is the most forgiving language I experienced so far. Javascript seems like a very potent programming language for
Software Engineering. I learnt new material in the recent module about simple form functions, different forms of array management and new variables and their different scopes and mutualities. 
As I go along completing new modules I will update this post. 
The WODs are a great tool this classs is providing. Although I can see them getting stressul as the semester goes on, I reckon it is tremendously helpful 
to prepare for later coding interviews. 314 is the only class so far that makes you code under time pressure, which I appreciate. I think the more we will complete
throughout this year the more accessible coding assignments will get and the less nervous I will be. Adding onto that, the WODs also provide a strictly set schedule for us,
that makes us deal with the learning material almost every day, which for me will work well. Completing assignments and having to deal with coding 6 days out of 7 will 
increase the slope of my learning curve. As I can state after two weeks of experience in this course, I think of it as very well balanced and I reckon it to be quite profitable for our ICS career.
