When I first started writing small programs in C, I did not really pay attention to the form or to the length and readibility of my code. For a long time I thought as long as it works why would anyone care how it looks if the end user cannot see it anyway. To the point I had my first computer science class in college I was arguing this view. However, I was totally wrong with that assumption. 
Nowadays I can not even imagine a collaboration on some sort of software that many people work on, if software engineers would not adhere to coding standars. I think it would be quite a chaos. I understand how important coding standards are as code needs to be easily and fast to read not only for the one who wrote it but for everyone el;se refering to it, especiallly in collaborations of many people. 
After using ESLint for the first week, I have to say it definitely was a chance to how I used to write code before, but not too drastical that I would not try to adjust to it. It may take a few weeks to write most of your code within the standars of this particular coding style on the first attempt, but who cares. I I think it is part of coding itself,that you just have to adjust to different languages and different required coding styles from time to time but it really does not take a lot to get into it.
What I would be interested in is to know if there are any attempts to make coding standards generalized, in a way how accounting standards work, like the GAAP in the U.S. I know there might be some troubles adjusting those for all the languages, but nevertheless something like that could be very useful.
