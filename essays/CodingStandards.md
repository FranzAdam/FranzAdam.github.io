When I first started writing small programs in C, I did not really pay attention to the form or to the length and readibility of my code. For a long time I thought as long as it works why would anyone care how it looks if the end user cannot see it anyway. Until to the point wheen I had my first computer science class in college I was arguing this position. However, I was totally wrong with that assumption. 
Nowadays I can not even imagine a collaboration on some sort of software that many people work on, if software engineers would not adhere to coding standars. It would be quite a chaos. I understand how important coding standards are as code needs to be read understood easily and fast not only for the one who wrote it but for everyone else refering to it, especiallly in collaborations of many people. 
After using ESLint for the first week, I have to say it definitely was a chance to how I used to write code before, but not a too drastical one. It may take a few weeks to write your code within the standars of this particular coding style on the first attempt, but that is no time really. I think it is part of coding itself, that you just have to adjust to different languages and different required coding styles from time to time but it really does not take a lot to get into it.
What I would be interested in is to know if there are any attempts to generalize coding standards. Perhaps it could work in a way how accounting standards work, like the GAAP in the U.S. I know there might be some troubles adjusting those for all the different languages, but nevertheless something like that could be very useful.
