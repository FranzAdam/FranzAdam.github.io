Html Experience
My experience with html was different in a way that this new language I was learning differed strongly from what I was used to so far.
 Coming from a C background as my first language, then going on to learning Java and C++ syntax and never working with websites before, 
html's syntax and its usage was very unique to me. When I did my first freecodecamps on html and got to know all these weird new brackets
and division we were supposed to use I felt like at my first day of class again. What generally frustrates people about coding is that you have to speak the computerâ€™s language, 
and you have to speak it well. You have to learn what tags mean what, which elements do what and what sections go where. It is demanding and you should schedule
a good amount of time for the seemingly easiest assignments. Apart from the syntax and structure however, for html, like other languages,
 I have endured and still ednure endless mistakes and constant consultation with html learning webpages.

UI Design
The way information is displayed and content is presented plays a very significant role for services and applications to be attractive and engaging.
From simple web applications over news article pages to websites that offer products, I think we can all admit that data/information representation  plays  very  important  role  for applications
to  be  more  attractive and responsive to us. It can certainly influence our decision whether or not to stay/buy on/from this page or not. 
All of that is decided the look of the User Interface. That is where semantic UI comes into place. As one design cannot fit varied preferences
 and be suitable for all users,and website templates or reusage of code for various websites 
effectively works up to only such a degree, and creating responsive and attractive webpages in html is a very tedious and long task, semantic ui 
offers an user friendly and simple solution. Semantic UI helps build very engaging and pleasing website layouts using natural language to do so.

Conclusion
My first interactions with semantic UI have been all very pleasing. It is a very easy coming UI framework that extends html code in a very concise
 and comprehensible way. With my prior experience of perhaps only 20hours of html, and the help of the semantic UI webpage, that lays out precise 
instructions and syntax examples, I was able to build much better looking webpages than with html in much less time. 
I have been using semantic UI ever since first introduced in one our WODs and beginning to get more and more comfortable with it. 
There is no doubt it is very useful tool for creating attractive webpages.
