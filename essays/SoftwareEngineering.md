Ever since I got my first computer and started playing video games I was interested in computer technology and its software. 
In the early stages I was more interested in the hardware. I used to buy each part from motherboard and RAM cards,
up to the display and mouse and put together my own PCs. I was very interested in video games during that time. 
At a later stage I began to mess aroung with different software and started to do some online coding camps just for fun and I developed an interest in how Software was built up
and how it worked together. Over the years in late High School I kind of lost interest in it, perhaps it was due to my focus on athletics or just because no one else of my friends were interested in it, so I rather spent my time with general enjoyable activities.
However once I enrolled in College and did not know what to study I thought back and realized I should continue where I left off and start again. 
It only took a couple of weeks until I found it very enjoyable again. Over the next two years and the remainder of my undergraduate experience I am hoping to get as much knowledge on the way as possible so I know what to focus on and do for my master's degree. So far I am panning to enroll in a Financial Engineering Program as I am also pursuing a B.S. in Mathematics and a Minor in Business and I as off now I think that is what I want to do.
But as I mentioned, I am trying to get as much information and idea of every CS path. Perhaps over the next ICS classes or even this class I will discover some path that I enjoy even more. Basically the experience I will gain in the next classes will shape my future.
