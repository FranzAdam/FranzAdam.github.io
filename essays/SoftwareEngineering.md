Ever since I got my first computer and started playing video games I was interested in computer technology and its software. 
In the early stages I was more interested in the hardware. I used to buy each part, from motherboard and RAM cards,
up to the display and mouse, and put them together.
At a later stage I began to mess aroung with different software and started to do some online coding camps just for fun and developed an interest in how Software was built up
and how it all worked together. Over the years in late High School I lost interest in it, perhaps it was due to my focus on athletics or just because no one else of my friends were interested as me, so I rather spent my time with general enjoyable activities.
However once I enrolled in college and did not quite know what to study I thought back and realized I should continue where I left off and start again. 
It only took a couple of weeks until I found it very enjoyable again. Over the next two years and the remainder of my undergraduate experience I am hoping to get as much knowledge on the way as possible so I know what to focus on and do for my master's degree. So far I am planning to enroll in a Financial Engineering Master's Program as I am also pursuing a B.S. in Mathematics and a Minor in Business and as off now I think that is what I want to do.
But as I mentioned, I am trying to get as much information and idea of every CS path. Perhaps over the next ICS classes or even this class I will discover some path that I enjoy even more. Basically, the experience I will gain in the next classes will shape my future.
